# Getting Started with Python

<SafePasswordStorage />

## Requirements

* [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org)
* [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip) >= 19.1
* [setuptools-rust](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-rust/) >= 0.10.2
* Make sure you have fulfilled the [Rust Getting Started](rust.mdx) requirements to compile the binding.

:::info Windows Requirements

For Windows you may need to install MSYS2 and Clang if you don't already have it. Our recommended way is to use [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=msys).
Install Chocolatey with 
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
and install the needed packages with
```
 choco install msys2 llvm
```

## Install the Library

### Clone the Repository

You can clone the [wallet.rs client library](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs) by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs
```

### Change to the Python Binding Directory

After you have cloned the repository, you should change directory to `wallet.rs/bindings/python/native`. You can do so
by
running the following command:

```bash
cd wallet.rs/bindings/python/native
```

#### (optional) Create and use a virtual environment

If you want to isolate the library from the rest of your system, you can create a virtual environment by running the
following commands:

```bash
python3 -m venv iota_wallet_venv
````
##### Linux and macOS

```bash
source iota_wallet_venv/bin/activate
```

##### Windows

```bash
.\iota_wallet_venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Install the Required Dependencies and Build the Wheel

Once you have [cloned the library](#clone-the-library),
and [moved to the binding's directory](#change-to-the-python-binding-directory), you should install dependencies and
build the wheel file.

You can do so by running the following commands:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
pip install .
```

#### (optional) Deactivate the virtual environment

If you want to deactivate the virtual environment, you should run the following command from the virtual environment:

```bash
deactivate
```

## Use the Library

After you have [installed the library](#install-the-library), you can create a `IotaWallet` instance and interact with
it.

```python
from iota_wallet import IotaWallet, StrongholdSecretManager

# This example creates a new database and account

client_options = {
    'nodes': ['https://api.testnet.shimmer.network'],
}

# Shimmer coin type
coin_type = 4219

secret_manager = StrongholdSecretManager("wallet.stronghold", "some_hopefully_secure_password")

wallet = IotaWallet('./alice-database', client_options, coin_type, secret_manager)

# Store the mnemonic in the Stronghold snapshot, this only needs to be done once
account = wallet.store_mnemonic("flame fever pig forward exact dash body idea link scrub tennis minute " +
          "surge unaware prosper over waste kitten ceiling human knife arch situate civil")

account = wallet.create_account('Alice')
print(account)
```

## What's Next?

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/bindings/python/native/examples).
