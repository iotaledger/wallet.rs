<WarningPasswordStorage/>

The [IOTA Wallet Node.js binding](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iota/wallet) is published
on [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/).

## Requirements

* Make sure you have fulfilled the [Rust Getting Started](rust.mdx) requirements to compile the binding.

One of:
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Install the Library

The package is published in [npmjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@iota/wallet). We also use _dotenv_ for password
management in the examples.

### npm

To install with `npm`, you can run the following command:

```bash
npm install @iota/wallet dotenv
```

### yarn

To install with `yarn`, you can run the following command:

```bash
yarn install @iota/wallet dotenv
```

## Use the Library

After you have [installed the library](#install-the-library), you can create
a [`AccountManager`](./../references/nodejs/classes/AccountManager.md)
instance and interface with it.

```javascript
const accountManagerOptions = {
    storagePath: './alice-database',
    clientOptions: {
        nodes: ['https://api.testnet.shimmer.network'],
        localPow: true,
    },
    coinType: CoinType.Shimmer,
    secretManager: {
        stronghold: {
            snapshotPath: `./wallet.stronghold`,
            password: `${process.env.SH_PASSWORD}`,
        },
    },
};

const manager = new AccountManager(accountManagerOptions);
```

## What's Next?

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/wallet/bindings/nodejs/examples).
