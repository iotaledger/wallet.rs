The wallet.rs library is published on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/iota-wallet/versions). You can also download
the source code from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs).

## Requirements

* [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

:::info

We recommend you update _Rust_ to the latest stable
version [rustup update stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#keeping-rust-up-to-date).

:::

The library uses [_cmake_](https://cmake.org/documentation/) and [_openssl_](https://www.openssl.org/docs/). You may
need install additional build tools on your system to run the build process successfully using Cargo.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value={'windows'} label={'Windows'}>
You can install all needed prerequisites on Windows with [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=msys). If you have any of the tools already installed just remove them from the command

Install Chocolatey with 
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
and install the needed packages with
```
choco install visualstudio2022buildtools visualstudio2022-workload-vctools rust-ms msys2 llvm
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value={'macOS'} label={'macOS'}>

You can install _cmake_ and _openssl_ with [_Homebrew_](https://docs.brew.sh/) by running the following commands:

```bash
brew install cmake
brew install openssl@1.1
# you may want to add this to your .zshrc or .bashrc since you'll need it to compile the crate
OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value={'linux'} label={'Linux'}>

You can install _cmake_ and _openssl_ with your distro's package manager or download from their websites. On Debian and
Ubuntu you will also need the [_build-essential_](https://packages.debian.org/sid/build-essential) package.

## Include the Library

The only thing you need to do to start using the library is to add it as dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml {2}
[dependencies]
iota-wallet = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs", branch = "develop" }
tokio = "1.21.2"
```

## Use the Library

In order to use the library, you need to create an `AccountManager`:

<WarningPasswordStorage/>


<CodeBlock className="language-rust" showLineNumbers metastring={'{12,37-42}'}>
    {CodeSample}
</CodeBlock>

## What's Next?

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/examples).
