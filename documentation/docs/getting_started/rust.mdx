# Getting Started with Rust

<SafePasswordStorage/>

## Prerequisites

* [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

We recommend you update _Rust_ to the latest stable
version [rustup update stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#keeping-rust-up-to-date).

## Dependencies

The library uses [_cmake_](https://cmake.org/documentation/) and [_openssl_](https://www.openssl.org/docs/). You may
need install additional build tools on your system to run the build process successfully using Cargo.

### Windows

You can download _cmake_ from the [official cmake website](https://cmake.org/download/).
You can install _openssl_ with [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) or [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

#### Install _openssl_ with _vcpkg_

You can run the following command to install _openssl_ with _vcpkg_:

```shell
./vcpkg.exe install openssl:x64-windows
./vcpkg.exe integrate install
```

You may want to add this to the system environment variables since you'll need it to compile the crate:

```shell
set VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC=1
```

#### Install _openssl_ with _chocolatey_

You can run the following command to install _openssl_ with _chocolatey_:

```shell
choco install openssl
```

You may need to set the `OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR` environment variable:

```shell
set OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR="C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64"
```

### macOS

You can install _cmake_ and _openssl_ with [_Homebrew_](https://docs.brew.sh/) by running the following commands:

```bash
brew install cmake
brew install openssl@1.1
# you may want to add this to your .zshrc or .bashrc since you'll need it to compile the crate
OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)
```

### Linux

You can install _cmake_ and _openssl_ with your distro's package manager or download from their websites. On Debian and
Ubuntu you will also need the [_build-essential_](https://packages.debian.org/sid/build-essential) package.

## Include the Library in Your `Cargo.toml`

The only thing you need to do to start using the library is to add it as dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```
[dependencies]
iota-wallet = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs", branch = "develop" }
```

## Use the Library

In order to use the library, you need to create an _AccountManager_:

```rust
use std::path::PathBuf;

use iota_wallet::{
    account_manager::AccountManager,
    iota_client::constants::SHIMMER_COIN_TYPE,
    secret::{stronghold::StrongholdSecretManager, SecretManager},
    ClientOptions, Result,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Shouldn't be hardcoded in production
    // mnemonic can be generated with `manager.generate_mnemonic()?` and will be the only way to recover your funds if
    // you loose the stronghold file/password, so be sure to save it securely
    let nonsecure_use_of_development_mnemonic = "endorse answer radar about source reunion marriage tag sausage weekend frost daring base attack because joke dream slender leisure group reason prepare broken river".to_string();
    let stronghold_password = "some_hopefully_secure_password";

    // Setup Stronghold secret_manager
    let mut secret_manager = StrongholdSecretManager::builder()
        .password(&stronghold_password)
        .snapshot_path(PathBuf::from("wallet.stronghold"))
        .build();

    // The mnemonic only needs to be stored the first time
    secret_manager
        .store_mnemonic(nonsecure_use_of_development_mnemonic)
        .await?;

    // Create the accounts_and_addresses manager with the secret_manager and client options
    let client_options = ClientOptions::new().with_node("http://localhost:14265")?;

    let manager = AccountManager::builder()
        .with_secret_manager(SecretManager::Stronghold(secret_manager))
        .with_client_options(client_options)
        .with_coin_type(SHIMMER_COIN_TYPE)
        .finish()
        .await?;

    // Create a new accounts_and_addresses, this will automatically generate an address
    let account = manager
        .create_account()
        .with_alias("Alice".to_string())
        .finish()
        .await?;

    println!(
        "Generated a new accounts_and_addresses with addresses {:?}",
        account.addresses().await?
    );

    Ok(())
}
```

## What's Next?

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/examples).
