## Security

<WarningPasswordStorage/>

## Requirements

* [Rust and Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html).

:::info

We recommend you update _Rust_ to the latest stable
version [rustup update stable](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#keeping-rust-up-to-date).

:::

The library uses [_cmake_](https://cmake.org/documentation/) and [_openssl_](https://www.openssl.org/docs/). You may
need install additional build tools on your system to run the build process successfully using Cargo.

### Windows

You can install all needed prerequisites on Windows with [Chocolatey](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages?q=msys). If you have any of the tools already installed just remove them from the command

Install Chocolatey with 
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```
and install the needed packages with
```
choco install visualstudio2022buildtools visualstudio2022-workload-vctools rust-ms msys2 llvm
```

### macOS

You can install _cmake_ and _openssl_ with [_Homebrew_](https://docs.brew.sh/) by running the following commands:

```bash
brew install cmake
brew install openssl@1.1
# you may want to add this to your .zshrc or .bashrc since you'll need it to compile the crate
OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)
```

### Linux

You can install _cmake_ and _openssl_ with your distro's package manager or download from their websites. On Debian and
Ubuntu you will also need the [_build-essential_](https://packages.debian.org/sid/build-essential) package.

## Include the Library in Your `Cargo.toml`

The only thing you need to do to start using the library is to add it as dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml {2}
[dependencies]
iota-wallet = { git = "https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs", branch = "develop" }
tokio = "1.21.2"
```

## Use the Library

In order to use the library, you need to create an _AccountManager_:

```rust
use std::path::PathBuf;

use iota_wallet::{
    account_manager::AccountManager,
    iota_client::constants::SHIMMER_COIN_TYPE,
    secret::{stronghold::StrongholdSecretManager, SecretManager},
    ClientOptions, Result,
};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<()> {
    // Shouldn't be hardcoded in production
    // mnemonic can be generated with `manager.generate_mnemonic()?` and will be the only way to recover your funds if
    // you loose the stronghold file/password, so be sure to save it securely
    let nonsecure_use_of_development_mnemonic = "endorse answer radar about source reunion marriage tag sausage weekend frost daring base attack because joke dream slender leisure group reason prepare broken river".to_string();
    let stronghold_password = "some_hopefully_secure_password";

    // Setup Stronghold secret_manager
    let mut secret_manager = StrongholdSecretManager::builder()
        .password(&stronghold_password)
        .build(PathBuf::from("wallet.stronghold"))?;

    // The mnemonic only needs to be stored the first time
    secret_manager
        .store_mnemonic(nonsecure_use_of_development_mnemonic)
        .await?;

    // Create the accounts_and_addresses manager with the secret_manager and client options
    let client_options = ClientOptions::new().with_node("http://localhost:14265")?;

    let manager = AccountManager::builder()
        .with_secret_manager(SecretManager::Stronghold(secret_manager))
        .with_client_options(client_options)
        .with_coin_type(SHIMMER_COIN_TYPE)
        .finish()
        .await?;

    // Create a new accounts_and_addresses, this will automatically generate an address
    let account = manager
        .create_account()
        .with_alias("Alice".to_string())
        .finish()
        .await?;

    println!(
        "Generated a new accounts_and_addresses with addresses {:?}",
        account.addresses().await?
    );

    Ok(())
}
```

## What's Next?

Now that you are up and running, you can get acquainted with the library using
its [how-to guides](../how_tos/run_how_tos.mdx) and the
repository's [code examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/examples).
