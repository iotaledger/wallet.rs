## Connect to the Testnet API

We recommended that you start your interactions with IOTA on a _testnet_ network. The _testnet_ will allow you to safely
get acquainted with the `wallet.rs` library, without the risk of losing any funds if you make a mistake along the way.
You can use this Shimmer Testnet API load balancer: 

```plaintext
https://api.testnet.shimmer.network
```

## Explore the Network

You can use the [Shimmer Tangle Explorer](https://explorer.shimmer.network/) to view transactions and data stored in
the IOTA Tangle.

## Get Test Tokens

In order to properly test value-based transactions on testnet network, you are going to need some tokens. You can get
some testnet tokens through the [Shimmer Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network).
