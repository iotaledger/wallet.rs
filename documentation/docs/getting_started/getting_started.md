# Getting Started

You can use this section to get your wallet up and running in
the [programming language of your choice](#available-programming-languages),
[connect to the testnet](#connect-to-the-testnet-api), [explore the network](#explore-the-network),
and [get test tokens](#get-test-tokens) to develop your application.

## Connect to the Testnet API

We recommended that you start your interactions with Shimmer on a _testnet_ network. The _testnet_ will allow you to
safely get acquainted with the `wallet.rs` library, without the risk of losing any funds if you make a mistake along the
way.

You can use this public load-balanced Shimmer Testnet API:

```plaintext
https://api.testnet.shimmer.network
```

## Explore the Network

You can use the [Shimmer Tangle Explorer](https://explorer.shimmer.network/testnet) to view transactions and data stored
in the Tangle.

## Get Test Tokens

In order to properly test value-based transactions on testnet network, you are going to need some tokens. You can get
some testnet tokens through the [Shimmer Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.shimmer.network).

## Available Programming Languages

The wallet.rs library is written in [Rust](./rust.mdx), and also has convenient bindings
in [Node.js](./nodejs.mdx), [Java](./java.mdx) and [Python](./python.mdx). Each of these languages has specific
instructions you will need to follow to use wallet.rs in your project.
