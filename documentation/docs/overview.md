# Overview

The wallet library is a stateful package with a standardized interface for developers to build applications involving IOTA value transactions. It provides abstractions to handle IOTA payments and can optionally interact with [IOTA Stronghold enclave](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/) for seed handling, seed storage and state backup.
