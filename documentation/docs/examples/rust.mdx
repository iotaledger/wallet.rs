# Examples in Rust

The examples for wallet.rs are located in the library's repository. To get access to them, clone the `wallet.rs` repository:

```bash
git clone -b production https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs.git
cd wallet.rs
```

You can list all available examples by running the following command:

```bash
cargo run --example # lists the available examples
```

To run an example, you can use the following command, replacing _transfer_ with the desired example:

```bash
cargo run --example transfer # execute the `transfer` example
```

You can find all examples in the `examples` subfolder of the project.

## Backup and Restore

1. Create an account manager and set a password:

```rust
let manager = AccountManager::builder().finish().await.unwrap();

manager.set_stronghold_password("password").await.unwrap();
manager.store_mnemonic(SignerType::Stronghold, None).await.unwrap();
```

2. Create your account:

```rust
let client_options = ClientOptionsBuilder::new()
    .with_node("https://api.lb-0.h.chrysalis-devnet.iota.cafe")?
    .build()
    .unwrap();
let account_handle = manager
    .create_account(client_options)?
    .alias("alias")
    .initialise()
    .await?;
let id = account_handle.id().await;
```

3. You can secure your account in a backup file:
```rust
// backup the stored accounts to ./backup/${backup_name}
let backup_path = manager.backup("./backup").await?;

```

4. You can import the backup later, or in another application using the following snippet:

```rust
manager.import_accounts(backup_path, "password").await?;

let imported_account_handle = manager.get_account(&id).await?;

let account = account_handle.read().await;
let imported_account = imported_account_handle.read().await;
```

That's it! You can now backup and restore your account!

You can see the full code for the example in the [`wallet.rs` repository](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/blob/production/examples/backup_and_restore.rs)


## Transfer

You use the following example to generate an account and transfer funds. 

<CodeBlock className="language-rust">
  {transfer}
</CodeBlock>

## Events

`wallet.rs` library is able to listen to several supported event. As soon as the event occurs, a provided callback will be triggered.

You can use the following example to fetch an existing _Account_ and listen to transaction events related to that _Account_ :

<CodeBlock className="language-rust">
  {event}
</CodeBlock>

## Logger

<CodeBlock className="language-rust">
  {logger}
</CodeBlock>
