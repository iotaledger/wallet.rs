## Run Code Examples

The wallet.rs library has numerous [examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/wallet/bindings/python/examples)
you can run to get acquainted with the library. After you have followed the instructions to
[install the library](./../getting_started/python#install-the-library), you can run any example with the following
command from the `bindings/python` directory:

```bash
python3 example/[example file name]
```

Where [example file name] is one of the
[examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/wallet/bindings/python/examples).

For instance, to run
[`00_get_info.py` ](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/blob/develop/bindings/python/examples/00_get_info.py),
you should run:


```bash
python3 examples/00_get_info.py
```
