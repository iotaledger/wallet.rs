## Installation

The easiest way to get python binding up and running is to leverage pre-built python libraries for linux, MacOs or Windows that can be installed to your python environment (3.6+) via _pip_ . The binding is automagically generated using github [actions](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/actions/workflows/python_binding_publish.yml).

You can download the latest artifacts for major python version using the  [nighly.link service](https://nightly.link/iotaledger/wallet.rs/workflows/python_binding_publish/develop).  
1. Download zip file for the given os and pyversion. 
2. Unpack wheel file ( _.whl_ ).
3. Install it via _pip_ by running the following command:

```bash
pip install <wheel_file>
```

Once it has been properly installed you can double-check the installation using _pip_ :
```bash
pip list
```

The pip list should now include the _iota-wallet-python-binding_:
```plaintext
Package                    Version
-------------------------- -------
iota-wallet-python-binding 0.1.0
```

Once you python environment has installed the `iota-wallet-python-binding` you can start developing using the python binding.

## Usage

To use the _iota_wallet_ you will need to add an import statement:  
```python
import iota_wallet
```
If you'd like more information on the _iota_wallet_ , you can print the documentation using the following snippet:
```python
print(iota_wallet.__doc__)
```
