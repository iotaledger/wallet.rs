## Prerequisites

Before you can run the examples, please refer to the [Node.js Getting Started guide](./../getting_started/nodejs) to install
the library.

## Set Up Your `.env` File

The examples use variables from a `.env` file. Though you can create your own, for the examples you can simply copy the
existing [`.env.example`](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/blob/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples/.env.example) file. You can
do this running the following command from the `bindings/nodejs/examples` directory:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Install Dependencies

Before you can try out the examples, you must install the necessary dependencies using npm. You can do this by running
the following command from the `binding/nodejs` directory:

```bash
npm i
```

### Build the Library

Once you have [set up your `.env` file](#setup-your-env-file) and [installed the necessary dependencies](#install-dependencies)
, you can build the library by running the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

### Run the Examples

The wallet.rs library has numerous examples you can run to get acquainted with the library.
After you have followed the instructions to [build the library](#build-the-library), you have to run the following command in `bindings/nodejs/examples`:

```bash
npm install
```

You will need to select any of the
[Node.js examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/bindings/nodejs/examples) and run it with
your local Node.js interpreter.

To run examples, you will need to change to the `bindings/nodejs/examples` directory, and run any example.
The following command will run the `10-node-info.js` example:

```bash
node 10-node-info.js
```
