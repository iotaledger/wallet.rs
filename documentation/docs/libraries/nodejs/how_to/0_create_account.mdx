title: How To Create An Account
---

import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MoreExamples from "./_more_examples.md";
import create_account from  '!!raw-loader!./../../../../../bindings/nodejs/examples/1-create-account.js';

All the examples expect you to set your custom password  in the _.env_ file and the first one also requires a mnemonic:

```bash
SH_PASSWORD="here is your super secure password"
MNEMONIC="here your 24 word mnemonic, it is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password and/or lose the stronghold file"
```

<CodeBlock className="language-javascript">
    {create_account}
</CodeBlock>
