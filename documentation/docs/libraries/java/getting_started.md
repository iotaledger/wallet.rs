# Getting Started with Java

## Prerequisites

To use the library, we recommend you update Rust to the latest stable version [`$ rustup update stable`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup.rs#keeping-rust-up-to-date). Nightly should be fine but some changes might not be compatible.

Ensure you have installed the [required dependencies for the library](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/blob/dev/README.md) first. Then, you can also install the following programs:

- Java & JDK (Make sure $JAVA_HOME env variable is set).
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) v4 or higher or [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).
- Cargo ndk (`cargo install cargo-ndk`).
- Cargo fmt (`rustup component add rustfmt`).


Download or clone the `wallet.rs` repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs.git
```

## Security

In a production setup, do not store passwords in the host's environment variables or in the source code. See our [backup and security recommendations](https://chrysalis.docs.iota.org/guides/backup_security) for production setups.


## Installation

To build using the Wallet.rs Java bindings, you will need:

1. JNI Native library linking `Rust` to `C`, and then `C` to java `native` methods (`.so` , `.dll` or `.dylib` depending on your system).
2. Java archive(Jar) containing `native` methods which call C code. (`.jar`).

### Step 1: Creating the Native Library

Build the wallet library (this generates the java source code and JNI library file):

```bash
cd wallet.rs/bindings/java
cargo build --release
```

You can find the generated binaries in `wallet.rs/bindings/java/target/release`.

:::note

Compiling for Android requires additional compilation instructions.

You can find these instructions in the [Android development](android_development) section.

### Step 2: Creating the Java Archive

#### Generating the source files and classes

After you complete step 1, you can find the Java generated source files under `wallet.rs/bindings/java/native/src/main/java/org/iota/wallet`.

If this step succeeds, you need to generate the jar file containing the newly generated Java source files.

#### Generating the jar

You can generate the jar file with your tool of preference. This guide provides examples for Gradle and Maven.

##### Gradle

Make `gradlew` executable (`chmod +x gradlew`) if needed, then run the following commands from the project root:

```bash
cd wallet.rs/bindings/java
./gradlew jar
```

##### Maven

```bash
cd wallet.rs/bindings/java
mvn install
```

After running one of these commands, you can find the jar file at `wallet.rs/bindings/java/native/build/libs/native.jar`

## Usage

You can find more information on using the `wallet.rs` library's java binding in the [examples section](examples.md).

### Gradle

```
./gradlew examples:java-app:test --info
```bash

### Maven

You can run the examples using Maven by running the following command:


```bash
mvn exec:exec
```

## API Reference

You can find the references for the binding's API in the [Java API Reference](api_reference) section.

## Limitations

Due to the fact that tje Java binding through C to Rust, there are a few limiting factors.

- Classic builder patterns return a `clone` after each builder call since we can only pass back to C by reference in `Rust` as shown in the example below.

```Java
Builder builder1 = new Builder();
Builder builder2 = builder1.setValue(true);

// These are different instances, thus builder1 wont have the value set
assertNotEquals(builder1, builder2);
```
