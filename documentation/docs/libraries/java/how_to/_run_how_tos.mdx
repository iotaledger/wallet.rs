import ExampleEnv from '!!raw-loader!../../../../../wallet/.env.example';
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the examples, please refer to the [Java Getting Started guide](./../getting_started/java) to install
the library

### Set Up Your .env file

The code examples use a `.env` file to store variables. You can download
the [example file](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/blob/develop/wallet/.env.example) or create a new one with
the following variables:

<CodeBlock className={'language-dotenv'}>
{ExampleEnv}
</CodeBlock>

The `.env.example` uses public [Shimmer Beta](https://wiki.iota.org/shimmer/introduction/reference/networks/betanet/)
URLS. If you want to use another node, you should update the `NODE_URL` and `FAUCET_URL` values to match the
[Hornet node](#hornet-node) you want to use.

## Run Code Examples

The IOTA Wallet Java library has numerous [examples](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/wallet/bindings/java/examples/src)
you can run to get acquainted with the library. You can run any example with the following
command from the `examples` directory:

```bash
.././gradlew run -Pexample=CreateAccount
```

To run another example of your choice, replace `CreateAccount` with the name of any other example from the [Java examples directory](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/tree/develop/wallet/bindings/java/examples/src).
