:::note Replace the native token ID

Before you run the code example, make sure to update the token ID with one which is available in your account. If you 
haven't done so already, you can follow the [how to mint a native token guide](../how_tos/native_tokens/01_mint_native_token.mdx). If you
don't know the token ID you can [check your accounts balance](../how_tos/accounts_and_addresses/04_check_balance.mdx) to retrieve
the available native tokens in your account.
