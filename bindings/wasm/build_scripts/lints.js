It causes runtime errors such as "Module not found: Error: Can't resolve 'env'".
This usually indicates a dependency trying to use or import non-Wasm-compatible code or libraries.

Common problematic crates and the feature flag required to be compatible:
- parking_lot <= 0.11.2, "wasm-bindgen" (0.12.0 deprecated the "wasm-bindgen" feature).
- instant 0.1, "wasm-bindgen".
- getrandom 0.2, "js".

SUGGESTION: Identify the problematic crate by comparing recent changes to Cargo.toml in this project and any
dependencies. Then, enable the relevant "js" or "wasm-bindgen" feature flag in Cargo.toml for that specific
dependency and version.

E.g. (only add this to Cargo.toml if they appear in Cargo.lock, and the version must match Cargo.lock).
getrandom = { version = "0.2", default-features = false, features = ["js"] }
instant = { version = "0.1", default-features = false, features = ["wasm-bindgen"] }
