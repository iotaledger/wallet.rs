# IOTA Wallet Library - Node.js binding

## Requirements (only for building the binary yourself)

Ensure you have first installed the required dependencies for the library [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/blob/dev/README.md) and on Windows also LLVM, our workflow uses `https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/download/llvmorg-11.0.1/LLVM-11.0.1-win64.exe`. On Windows, you may also need to set an environment variable `RUSTFLAGS` to `-C target-feature=+crt-static`.

## Installation

- Using NPM:

```sh
npm i @iota/wallet
```

- Using yarn: 

```sh
yarn add @iota/wallet
```

## Installation in repository

Installing nodejs bindings require a [supported version of Node and Rust](https://github.com/neon-bindings/neon#platform-support).

This fully installs the project, including installing any dependencies and running the build.

## Building nodejs bindings

If you have already installed the project and only want to run the build, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command uses the [cargo-cp-artifact](https://github.com/neon-bindings/cargo-cp-artifact) utility to run the Rust build and copy the built library into `./build/Release/index.node`.
Prebuild requires that the binary is in `build/Release` as though it was built with node-gyp.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs the project, including running `npm run build`.

### `npm build`

Builds the Node addon (`index.node`) from source.

### `npm test`

Runs the unit tests by calling `cargo test`. You can learn more about [adding tests to your Rust code](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html) from the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

### Cargo.toml

The Cargo [manifest file](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html), which informs the `cargo` command.

### README.md

This file.

### index.node

The Node addon—i.e., a binary Node module—generated by building the project. This is the main module for this package, as dictated by the `"main"` key in `package.json`.

Under the hood, a [Node addon](https://nodejs.org/api/addons.html) is a [dynamically-linked shared object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries). The `"build"` script produces this file by copying it from within the `target/` directory, which is where the Rust build produces the shared object.

### package.json

The npm [manifest file](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json), which informs the `npm` command.

### src/

The directory tree containing the Rust source code for the project.

### src/lib.rs

The Rust library's main module.

### target/

Binary artifacts generated by the Rust build.
