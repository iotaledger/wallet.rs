# IOTA Wallet Libraries

There are currently available the following official bindings to `wallet.rs`:
- [Rust](./rust/) 
- [Node.js](./nodejs/) 
- [Python](./python/)

## Getting Started
It is a recommended approach to start your interactions with IOTA on a `testnet` network. Our official libraries incorporate an automatic node discovery mechanism and so endpoint API is not important to get you started. 

Network explorer is available at [IOTA Tangle Explorer](https://explorer.iota.org/chrysalis).

In order to properly test value-based transactions on testnet network, you are going to need some tokens! You can get testnet tokens using the [faucet](https://faucet.testnet.chrysalis2.com/).
