# Overview

The wallet library is a stateful package with a standardised interface for developers to build applications involving IOTA value transactions.
It offers abstractions to handle IOTA payments and can optionally interact with [IOTA Stronghold](https://github.com/iotaledger/stronghold.rs/) for seed handling, seed storage and state backup. Alternatively you can use the EnvMnemonic SignerType and a SQLite database. See the full specification [here](https://github.com/iotaledger/wallet.rs/blob/master/specs/wallet-ENGINEERING-SPEC-0000.md).
