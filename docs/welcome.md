# Welcome
This is the documentation for the official IOTA Wallet Library Software. It can be used to easily intgrate an IOTA Wallet into your applications.

`Wallet.rs` is a general wallet library written in Rust. It is being utilized by our wallet software `Firefly` and other software components across IOTA ecosystem. `Wallet.rs` contains all the logic to safely build wallets or integrations that require wallet or value-based transfers (such as exchanges, pay-as-you-go systems, etc.). It includes account state management and backup, account creation, transferring tokens and much more. Needless to say, it is also based on our official `one-source-code-of-truth` [IOTA Rust library](https://github.com/iotaledger/iota.rs) and may be integrated with [Stronghold component](https://blog.iota.org/iota-stronghold-6ce55d311d7c/) to achieve a maximum level of security and security best practices.
